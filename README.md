# Introduction
  - just another way to select buffers to display on a window
  - create delete save and close buffers
# Todo :
  - split windows ( horizontally and vertically ) while opening specific buffers in it aswell
  - keep window when delete buffer ( replace with any open buffer )
  - maybe window management feature ?
  - grep implementation to find buffers
